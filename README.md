To do-list made by Terhi Petäjäjärvi & Tiia Kiviluoma

Our application is to do-list, where you can add tasks, delete, make changes to them (double click said task).
It counts how many tasks you have in total.
It gives error message if you try to add too short string.

We both see that our cooperation was great.
When refenrencing to an evaluation table, we think we checked all marks for 30 points.

We have dynamic events and extra functionality (error messages, different ways to show task done/undone),
we have deployed in the cloud/netlify, we have repository in Github with collaboration access for Tiia,
we have that readMe-file, error free code and nice UI.
